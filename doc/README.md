## Introduce

[xray](https://github.com/chaitin/xray) is an excellent web vulnerability scanning tool, But only the command line version, Start via `config.yaml` file. In many cases, it is difficult to get started, and a GUI tool is needed to help newcomers use it faster. This tool is just a simple command line wrapper, not a direct method call. In the planning of xray, there will be a truly perfect GUI version of XrayPro tool in the future. Please look forward to it.

This project was tested under `JRE 19 ` and `JRE 11`, in `Windows 11` and `Ubuntu 22.04` and `Mac OS 12`.
